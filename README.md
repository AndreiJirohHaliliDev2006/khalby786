## TO ALL THE ALIENS FROM EARTH

*I am from Mars! I am inevitable.*

It's me, Khaleel Gibran. You've probably never heard of me. And I've never thought of writing a README for myself. Usually READMEs are written for applications and softwares, but here I am writing a README about me. READ me. And you cannot star this repo, even if you click the <kbd>Star</kbd> button.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Jsoning and whole lot of other stuff.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React, Vue and Typescript.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on maintaining repos made with JS.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with currently nothing.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js, some Vue, donuts, Blender 2.79 and my Twitter username.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: 

<kbd>Twitter</kbd> <kbd>Email</kbd> <kbd>Discord</kbd> <kbd>More...</kbd>

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He, him, donut and definitely not an 'it'.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love donuts. I really love donuts.

  * HTML
  * CSS
  * Javascript
  * Node.js - I am obsessed with Node. Really obsessed. And Express is my next best friend.
  * Vue - I just finished learning basics of Vue, now to move on to Advanced Vue! YAAY!

  * HTML - like I learned about `<base>` tag last week.
  * CSS - `@media` property
  * JS - there's something called `Object.hasOwnProperty(obj)`
  * Node.js - Express middleware
  * Vue - Vuex and advanced Vue
  * React - this thing's really cool but I prefer Vue over React
  * Typescript - nothing to say about this

I randomly post random tweets and fleets on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/khalby786), and sometimes useful tweets. GitHub is where I am right now, so make sure to star **all** my repos and eventually follow me *if* you liked them :). The [Glitch Support Forum](https://support.glitch.com) is where I hang out very much often. Discord (khalby786#1531) is much better than all the other chat applications out there. And a bigger and better README about reading me can be found at https://khaleelgibran.com.

**PETITION TO PIN MORE THAN 6 REPOS IN A PROFILE**

*Oh my, this is a really long READ me!*
